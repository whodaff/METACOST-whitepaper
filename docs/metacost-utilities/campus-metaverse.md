# Campus Metaverse

**Campus Metaverse** is the main project of Metacost which is currently in the development process, Metaverse Campus is a complex or area in which there is a Metaverse digital-based university building (Campus).

Studying on the Metaverse Campus is similar to studying on the Physical Campus (Offline) which differs only in the place, atmosphere and learning mechanism. The Metaverse Campus uses an LMS (Learning Management System) mechanism that will allow students to take lessons anywhere and anytime.

Metacost develops and implements the Metaverse Campus which is directly integrated with the Cryptocurrency Blockchain. Inside the Metaverse Campus, characters are used which are of course different for each student because they are the identity of the student in the Metaverse Campus.

The Metaverse Campus will create its own curriculum for learning materials on the Metaverse Campus and of course it will be registered with the Higher Education and the Ministry of Education and Culture, and the Metaverse Campus is conducting licensing and administrative completeness related to Digital University.

Metacost created this Metaverse-based Digital Campus, one of which is so that students can get to know the development of the digital era and technology, namely Metaverse and Blockchain.

### Campus Metaverse Functions :

#### •  More Fun Learning Experiences.

The Metaverse Campus will provide a more enjoyable learning experience because it is not just listening to lecturers explain learning materials, but the use of 3D technology makes the learning process look more real.

#### • Campus Metaverse 3D Concept

3D Concepts within the Metaverse Campus can allow students to engage in real-world activities. Students can browse classrooms with similar designs on the Physical Campus, sit in class to participate in the learning process and have face-to-face discussions.

#### •  Keeping Students Active in Learning.

Listening to the lecturer explain through the computer or smartphone layer inside the Metaverse Campus will reduce boredom compared to the Physical Campus where lecturers and students only see the same thing as a blackboard in front of it. The teaching and learning process will run smoothly with the 3D concept promoted by Metaverse. For this reason, Metacost created Campus Metavere because Metaverse will later become one of the important uses of technology in the industrial sector, including in the education sector.
