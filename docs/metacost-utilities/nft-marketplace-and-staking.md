# NFT (Marketplace & Staking)

## NFT Metacost

NFT METACOST will be used in various Metacost projects after being used as an asset, and you can get Multi-Benefits in Metacost projects.

## NFT Marketplace

METACOST will provide the NFT Market Platform which is displayed and traded. Everyone can sell and buy NFT provided in this NFT market.

NFT Market is a platform where NFT is displayed and traded. An NFT marketplace is an NFT marketplace or site that functions like Amazon or eBay to sell or buy various items but focuses on NFT products.

In this marketplace, you can also sell NFTs, which represent ownership of unique assets or goods, whether physical or intangible or digital.

## NFT Staking

NFT staking is NFT locking on a platform or protocol for receiving staking rewards and other benefits. The stakes are not much different from the token or coin bets. The difference is only in assets. NFT betting means NFT assets are staked or locked to be staked for prizes.

METACOST will develop a second platform from the NFT Marketplace, namely NFT Staking, so that NFT Metacost holders who have purchased from the Metacost NFT Marketplace platform themselves can be used for staking on this platform.
