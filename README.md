### About Metacost

Metacost is the main project of PT Metaverse Ekosistem Digital Indonesia and was created by ICMI MUDA and PDCI which focuses on developing a digital campus based on Metaverse.

The Digital Campus developed by Metacost is the first Metaverse-based Digital Campus in Indonesia, this Digital Campus will create a new learning atmosphere that is competitive, efficient and can be accessed by anyone and anytime because this Education is Virtual.

### Metacost Project Goals

The presence of a Metaverse-based Digital Campus is expected to be a solution for everyone who wants to learn virtually (online) and all ages who have never previously studied at an educational institution (university) because they want to achieve a D1 vocational IT (Technology) education level at the University.

All young or old people who wish to study or enroll in this Metaverse Campus are required to have completed High School Education or Vocational High School or other Education equivalent outside of school.

### Solution to problem

Metacost under the legal auspices of PT Metaverse Ekosistem Digital Indonesia and created by ICMI MUDA and PDCI is expected to solve the problems that exist in education in Indonesia, especially remote access to go to the Physical Campus (Offline).

The Metaverse Campus can solve the problems faced by several prospective students who want to continue their education from High School or Vocational High School to D1 Education level and the equivalent.
